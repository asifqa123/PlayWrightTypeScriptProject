**Test Failure Analysis Report**

Here's a summary of the findings from the `error-context.md` files:

**1. Error: `locator.innerText: Timeout 10000ms exceeded.`**
    *   **Test File:** `tests/addProductsInCart.spec.js`
    *   **Test Case:** `Test Case 12: Add Products in Cart >> should add specified products to cart and verify them`
    *   **Error Message:** `TimeoutError: locator.innerText: Timeout 10000ms exceeded.`
    *   **Stack Trace Snippet:**
        ```
        Call log:
          - waiting for locator('//div[@class=\'productinfo\' and ./p[normalize-space(text())=\'Blue Top\']]/h2').first()
        at ProductsPage.getProductPriceFromListing (/app/pages/ProductsPage.js:104:36)
        at /app/tests/addProductsInCart.spec.js:42:65
        ```
    *   **Potential Cause:** Timeout. The test timed out waiting to get the `innerText` of a product price locator. This could be due to the locator `productPriceListing(name)` in `ProductsPage.js` being incorrect, the element not being visible or present on the page when expected, or a slow page load. The locator `'//div[@class='productinfo' and ./p[normalize-space(text())='Blue Top']]/h2'` is used to find the price.
    *   **Involved POM File(s):** `pages/ProductsPage.js`

**2. Error: `locator.hover: Timeout 10000ms exceeded.` (Multiple Occurrences)**
    *   **Common Error Message:** `TimeoutError: locator.hover: Timeout 10000ms exceeded.`
    *   **Common Stack Trace Snippet (example):**
        ```
        Call log:
          - waiting for locator('//div[@class=\'productinfo\' and ./p[normalize-space(text())=\'Blue Top\']]').first()
        at ProductsPage.addProductToCartByName (/app/pages/ProductsPage.js:96:39)
        ```
    *   **Potential Cause:** Timeout. These errors occur when trying to `.hover()` over a product container. The specific XPath `//div[@class='productinfo' and ./p[normalize-space(text())='PRODUCT_NAME']]` is timing out. This suggests the product with the given name is not found, not visible, or the locator itself is not correctly identifying the element on the page.
    *   **Involved POM File(s):** `pages/ProductsPage.js`
    *   **Occurrences:**
        *   **Test File:** `tests/placeOrderLoginBeforeCheckout.spec.js`
            *   **Test Case:** `Test Case 16: Place Order: Login before Checkout >> should login with existing user, add product, and complete order`
            *   **Product Name in Locator:** 'Blue Top'
        *   **Test File:** `tests/placeOrderRegisterBeforeCheckout.spec.js`
            *   **Test Case:** `Test Case 15: Place Order: Register before Checkout >> should register, login, add product, and complete order`
            *   **Product Name in Locator:** 'Men Tshirt'
        *   **Test File:** `tests/placeOrderRegisterWhileCheckout.spec.js`
            *   **Test Case:** `Test Case 14: Place Order: Register while Checkout >> should complete order by registering during checkout`
            *   **Product Name in Locator:** 'Blue Top'
        *   **Test File:** `tests/removeProductsFromCart.spec.js`
            *   **Test Case:** `Test Case 17: Remove Products From Cart >> should add products, remove one, and verify cart content`
            *   **Product Name in Locator:** 'Blue Top'

**3. Error: `locator.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded: Timeout 10000ms exceeded.` (Multiple Occurrences)**
    *   **Common Error Message:** `TimeoutError: locator.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded: Timeout 10000ms exceeded.`
    *   **Common Stack Trace Snippet (example):**
        ```
        Call log:
          - waiting for locator('#subscribe_email')
        at Utils.scrollToElement (/app/utils/utils.js:62:23)
        ```
    *   **Potential Cause:** Timeout. The test timed out trying to scroll to the element with locator `'#subscribe_email'`. This implies the element was not found or not interactable within the timeout period.
    *   **Involved POM File(s):** `utils/utils.js`, `pages/CartPage.js`, `pages/HomePage.js` (as they call `scrollToElement` for the subscription input).
    *   **Occurrences:**
        *   **Test File:** `tests/verifyCartPageSubscription.spec.js`
            *   **Test Case:** `Test Case 11: Verify Subscription in Cart page >> should subscribe with an email on the cart page and verify success message`
            *   **Note:** The page snapshot shows "Cart is empty!". The subscription form might behave differently or not be present when the cart is empty.
        *   **Test File:** `tests/verifyHomepageSubscription.spec.js`
            *   **Test Case:** `Test Case 10: Verify Subscription in home page >> should subscribe with an email and verify success message`

**4. Error: `expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality (Expected: true, Received: false)`**
    *   **Test File:** `tests/verifyProductQuantityInCart.spec.js`
    *   **Test Case:** `Test Case 13: Verify Product quantity in Cart >> should set product quantity, add to cart, and verify quantity in cart`
    *   **Error Message:** `Error: expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality \n\n Expected: true \n Received: false`
    *   **Stack Trace Snippet:**
        ```
        at /app/tests/verifyProductQuantityInCart.spec.js:54:56
        ```
        This corresponds to the line: `expect(await cartPage.isShoppingCartVisible()).toBe(true);`
    *   **Potential Cause:** Assertion Failure. The `cartPage.isShoppingCartVisible()` method returned `false`, but the test expected it to be `true`. This means the shopping cart page content (specifically the element targeted by `shoppingCartText` locator in `CartPage.js`) was not visible.
    *   **Involved POM File(s):** `pages/CartPage.js`

**5. Error: `expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality (Expected: 27, Received: 0)`**
    *   **Test File:** `tests/verifyTestCasesPage.spec.js`
    *   **Test Case:** `Test Case 7: Verify Test Cases Page >> should navigate to the test cases page and verify its visibility`
    *   **Error Message:** `Error: expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality \n\n Expected: 27 \n Received: 0`
    *   **Stack Trace Snippet:**
        ```
        at /app/tests/verifyTestCasesPage.spec.js:37:57
        ```
        This corresponds to the line: `expect(await testCasesPage.getTestCasesCount()).toBe(27);`
    *   **Potential Cause:** Assertion Failure. The `testCasesPage.getTestCasesCount()` method returned `0`, but the test expected `27`. This indicates that the locators used within `getTestCasesCount` in `TestCasesPage.js` are not finding the test case elements as expected.
